# Welcome to my GitHub!
I am looking forward to doing some meaningful work as well as work 
that I have an interest in outside of the classroom. I've worked with 
other repositories in the past but GitHub has been a far easier way to 
collaborate with others. Thanks for stopping by! :smiley:  

## What Are My Goals on GitHub?
- To gain a solid foundation on the workings of colaborative coding 
- Work on some meaningful projects
- To create several of my own repositories and projects
- Expand my knowledge of technology 
- Apply in classroom concepts to out of class projects

## A Little Bit About Myself 
I am currently a Computer Science and Engineering student going into my fourth
year of schooling. Technology has always been a love of mine and I enjoy 
creating/building new things as well as making my ideas a reality. As it 
was once said to me, and I took it to heart, I believe that the best part
about computer programming/developement is that unlike a lot of other 
project types, most of the time the ideas that you can create are only limited 
by your own imagination which leads to endless possibilites. I look forward to
contributing to the GitHub community, and working to build something great!
